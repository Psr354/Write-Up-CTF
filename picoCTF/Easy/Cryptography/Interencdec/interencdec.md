The [enc_flag](enc_flag.png)... what do they mean?


## Solving
I use cat for open the file then i get this output **YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclh6YzRNalV3YUcxcWZRPT0nCg==**, when i saw the output i'am already know its base64 then i use this online tool     and get this output b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrXzc4MjUwaG1qfQ==' then i decode again with same tool, and i get this output "wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_78250hmj}" after saw the output i think its ROT13/Caesar chiper, so first i try the caesar chiper with this online tools     then i get this output "picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_78250afc}"

decoded flag= **picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_78250afc}**
