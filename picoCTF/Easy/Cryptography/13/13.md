# 13 - picoCTF Challenge Write-Up

## Challenge Description

![Challenge Screenshot](image.png)

In this challenge, we are given a file called `enc_flag.txt`. The description is brief and cryptic:
> "The enc_flag... what do they mean?"

Our goal is to discover the meaning behind the encrypted flag.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Investigating the File

First, letâ€™s check the contents of `enc_flag.txt`. Open the file or use the following command:
```bash
cat enc_flag.txt
```
The contents look like this:
```
YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclh6YzRNalV3YUcxcWZRPT0nCg==
```

### 2. Recognizing Base64 Encoding

The string looks suspiciously like Base64 encoding (it contains `=` padding at the end, and is typical length and format).
To decode it, you can use the `base64` command:
```bash
echo "YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclh6YzRNalV3YUcxcWZRPT0nCg==" | base64 -d
```
Output:
```
b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrXzc4MjUwaG1qfQ=='
```



Input:
```bash
echo "d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrXzc4MjUwaG1qfQ==" | base64 -d
```
Output:
```
wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_78250hmj}
```

### 3. Recognizing Caesar Cipher

The text looks like a Caesar cipher it's all letters, no weird symbols, and the spacing looks like real words, but nothing makes sense. This usually means each letter was shifted by a fixed amount in the alphabet To decode it, you can use the online tools [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/):

### 4. The Flag

The decoded flag is:
```
picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_78250afc}
```

## Technical Concepts Used

- **ROT13:**  is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).

## Tips and References

- Always check for common encodings (Base64, Hex, etc.) when presented with random-looking strings.
- Use built-in command line tools such as `base64`, `xxd`, or online decoders for quick analysis.

## Conclusion

This challenge required decoding two layers: first, the text was Base64-encoded. After decoding it, the result was still unreadable because it was encrypted using a Caesar cipher. Once the correct shift was applied, the flag was revealed. Understanding both encoding (like Base64) and classic ciphers (like Caesar) is key in CTF crypto challenges.
